<p>Hi, I’m Raj, a data scientist. I help organisations use data to make well informed business decisions.</p>
<p>In June 2017, I joined the C1X team as a data scientist. Currently I’m working on building a category reporting system for a large ecommerce client.</p>
<p>Previously I have:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Enabled data access to the entire organization by setting up Apache Superset and Metabase. This helped folks access reports in a self-service manner using industry-leading tools. Allowing easy access to rich reports is truly a game-changer in any organization</p></li>
<li><p>Developed a URL classification model to identify and enrich an ad impression to provide more context for campaign selection</p></li>
<li><p>AWS cost optimisation by developing a routing model to match ad impressions with bidders.</p></li>
<li><p>Identifying top monetisation friendly users based on various buying intents. This helped us identify which publisher had a premium audience and made us focus more of our efforts on growing those accounts.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Outside all this, I love cooking, bit of poetry and morning walks.</p>
<p>I’ve lived in Bengaluru(India) since 2017 but grew up in New Delhi (India).</p>
