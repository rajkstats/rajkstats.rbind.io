Recently, I came across a situation where I would have to write a R library
which is not available in Python. I was working on a machine learning pipeline
in Python where I had to combine all pre-processing into a one single flow.
Ofcourse, you are not limited to these libraries. You can always add your own
functions in Python. However, author of that R package has done a pretty good
work and in interest of time, I wanted to use it in one of my workflows.


I was in a situation where I had only few options:

1. Use R and python scripts separately and merge the results at last all
   together in a different script.
2. Implement that library in Python
3. Use rpy2

rpy2 is a python package which allows you to use R functionalities in Python
environment. Basically, you need to import R libraries using rpy2 functions in
Python environment. Also, it allows you to convert your R objects to Python
objects back and forth (for ex: Converting R and Python dataframes back and
forth ). In this article, I will walk you through implementation of
stringdist in python which is an awesome package to calculate distance between
two strings using different methods. Idea of writing this article here is to
show implementation of stringdist R package in python environment using rpy2.

```python
import rpy2
import rpy2.robjects as robjects
import rpy2.robjects.packages as rpackages
from rpy2.robjects.packages import importr
from pandas import read_csv
import pandas as pd

# pandas2ri to convert dataframes back and forth in R and
# python dataframes

# useful: when you want to load a R dataframe and then convert
# to pandas df or vice-versa

from rpy2.robjects import pandas2ri

# Installing required packages from R in rpy2 to use function


# Importing utils from R to install required packages
utils= importr('utils')


#You can pass a list of R packages in packnames below
packnames = ('stringdist','base')

# R vector of strings
from rpy2.robjects.vectors import StrVector

# Selectively install what needs to be install.
# We are fancy, just because we can.
names_to_install = [x for x in packnames
if not rpackages.isinstalled(x)]

if len(names_to_install) > 0:
utils.install_packages(StrVector(names_to_install))

```

Reading a movies dataset with title and ratings and a dataset with corresponding
messy movie titles to calculate string distance between two titles using
different methods which I have used in this jupyter notebook.

Looking at the datasets:

```python
movies= read_csv('/Users/raj/Desktop/stringdist/movies.txt')
```

```python
messy_movie_titles= read_csv('/Users/raj/Desktop/stringdist/
user_queries.txt')

# Assingning column name messy_title
messy_movie_titles.columns = ['messy_title']

messy_movie_titles.head()
```

![png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rajkstats/rajkstats.rbind.io/master/static/post/2018-04-24-rpy2_files/figure-html/img2.png)


```python
#Combining orginal movie title and
# messy movie title in one dataframe
# Since R stringdist expects an input in same way

result=pd.concat([movies['title'],
messy_movie_titles['messy_title']],
axis=1,ignore_index=False)

result.columns = ['title','messy_title']

result.head()
# Calculating distance between strings
# using stringdist R package with methods
# Levenshtein ,Cosine And Jaccard Distance

# importing stringdist package in python
# using importr function

stringdist = importr('stringdist')


#Lets check type of the result object
type(result)

pandas.core.frame.DataFrame

```

Need to convert this Python pandas dataframe to R data frame using pandas2ri to
pass to stringdist function which expects an R df as input.


```python
pandas2ri.activate()
robjects.globalenv['result'] = result
# Calculating Levenshtein distance between the two titles
ld =stringdist.stringdist(result['title'],
result['messy_title'],
 method='lv')

result['Levenshtein_distance'] = 0
result['Levenshtein_distance'] = ld


# Calculating Cosine distance between the two titles


cd =stringdist.stringdist(result['title'],
result['messy_title'],
method='cosine',q=2)
result['Cosine_distance'] = 0
result['Cosine_distance'] = cd


# Calculating Jaccard distance between the two titles

jd =stringdist.stringdist(result['title'],
result['messy_title'],
 method='jaccard',q=2)
result['Jaccard_distance'] = 0
result['Jaccard_distance'] = jd

#Printing final data frame which contains the results from all distances
```
