/* Hack
 * source: https://github.com/liwenyip/hugo-easy-gallery/issues/23
 *
 * This is a hack:
 *
 * hugo-easy-gallery puts a "caption" into the image.
 * my hugo theme (icarus) formats a "class = 'caption'" for images.
 * But as the hugo easy gallery plugin renders its own caption with the
 * <figcaption> tag, we don't need to see that hugo caption.
 *
 * So we hide it.
